# Healthcare in Different States

This project analyzes healthcare costs related to chest pain diagnoses across different US states. Using a hospital charges dataset, we explore cost distributions, variations by state, and identify trends and outliers.

## Dataset

- The data comes from Codecademy (`healthcare.csv`).
- Focus is on the diagnosis code related to chest pain (`DRG Definition` = '313 - CHEST PAIN').

## Tools Used

- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- Data analysis and visualization with boxplots to compare costs across states

## Objectives

- Filter healthcare data to focus on chest pain diagnosis
- Visualize cost distribution across all U.S. states using boxplots
- Identify states with highest/lowest median costs and variability

## Key Findings

- States like California, New Jersey, and Florida have the largest cost spreads.
- Vermont has very consistent costs with almost no spread.
- New Jersey has the highest median cost; Maryland has the lowest.
- Outliers are notable in California, Georgia, and Tennessee.
